# Election 2018 Forecast

The Democrats will take the House, 236-199.
The Republicans will pick up one seat in the Senate, 52-48.

___________________________________________________________

Of the two red state-Democratic Senators in danger, Senator Heidi Heitkamp will lose her seat. 
Heitkamp's decision to vote against Kavanaugh's nomination only drove home what North Dakotans already knew:
Heitkamp's too liberal for North Dakota.

No other Senate seats will turn party.


Though pundits would have you believe Kavanaugh sparked a "Republican resurgance", this is not true. 
Had there been no nomination, the RNC would have found a different rallying cry as an October Surprise (i.e. Caravan).
Whatever "Republican resurgance" we have seen will not translate effectively into votes because, still, 
the Republican Party has no forward-looking policy message. The Democratic Party, 
though notorious for lacking a coherent message, have one: a check on Trump. 
This will translate to the votes needed for Democrats in this election. Democrats will not be able to push many 
Republicans to vote Democrat, but they will push non-voters to being voters!
